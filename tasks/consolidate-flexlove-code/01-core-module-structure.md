# 01. Consolidate Core Module Structure

meta:
  id: consolidate-flexlove-code-01
  feature: consolidate-flexlove-code
  priority: P2
  depends_on: []
  tags: [implementation, refactor]

objective:
- Consolidate all FlexLove functionality into a single logical module structure with clear separation of concerns

deliverables:
- Refactored FlexLove.lua with consolidated core module structure
- Clear separation between utility classes and main GUI system
- Simplified initialization and configuration process

steps:
- Review current codebase structure to identify redundant or duplicated functionality
- Consolidate utility classes (Color, RoundedRect, NineSlice) into single logical sections
- Merge related modules like Units, Grid, Enums into unified structures
- Remove duplicate helper functions and consolidate common operations
- Simplify the main GUI initialization process
- Ensure all existing functionality remains intact

tests:
- Unit: Test that all core module functions work correctly after consolidation
- Integration/e2e: Verify that GUI elements can be created and rendered properly
- Integration/e2e: Ensure theme system works with consolidated structure

acceptance_criteria:
- All core functionality is preserved and accessible through the same API
- No breaking changes to existing code using FlexLove
- Module structure is cleaner and more maintainable
- Performance remains consistent or improved

validation:
- Run all existing tests to verify functionality still works
- Create a basic example that uses the consolidated library to ensure it works end-to-end

notes:
- The original codebase has many utility classes scattered throughout
- There are multiple helper functions that could be consolidated into single modules
- Need to maintain backward compatibility while simplifying structure
