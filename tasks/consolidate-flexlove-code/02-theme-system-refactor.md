  tags: [implementation, refactor]

objective:
- Refactor the theme system to improve structure and reduce redundancy while maintaining full functionality

deliverables:
- Consolidated theme system with simplified API
- Improved theme inheritance and support mechanisms
- Better integration between themes and UI elements

steps:
- Review current theme system implementation for duplicated logic or redundant functions
- Consolidate theme loading and initialization into single logical flow
- Simplify theme inheritance mechanism to make it more intuitive
- Remove duplicate theme-related helper functions
- Improve theme application to UI elements process
- Ensure all existing theme functionality works with updated structure

tests:
- Unit: Test that theme loading and application work correctly after refactoring
- Integration/e2e: Verify that themes can be applied to elements and inherited properly
- Integration/e2e: Ensure theme system doesn't break existing functionality

acceptance_criteria:
- Theme system remains fully functional with no breaking changes
- Theme inheritance works as expected
- Theme application to UI elements is simplified and more efficient
- Performance of theme operations is maintained or improved

validation:
- Run all existing theme-related tests
- Create a test example that demonstrates theme inheritance and application
- Verify that existing examples still work with the refactored system

notes:
- The current theme system has some redundancy in handling different theme types
- Theme inheritance logic could be simplified to make it more predictable
- Theme application to elements could benefit from consolidation of related functions
