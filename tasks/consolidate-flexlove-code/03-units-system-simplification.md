  priority: P2
  depends_on: [consolidate-flexlove-code-01]
  tags: [implementation, refactor]

objective:
- Simplify and consolidate the units system to improve clarity and reduce redundancy

deliverables:
- Unified units handling with consistent APIs
- Simplified unit conversion logic
- Improved support for different unit types (px, %, em, etc.)

steps:
- Review current units implementation for duplicated or redundant functions
- Consolidate unit type definitions into a single logical structure
- Simplify unit conversion and calculation processes
- Remove duplicate helper functions related to units
- Ensure all existing unit functionality works with updated system
- Improve documentation and clarity of unit handling

tests:
- Unit: Test that unit conversions work correctly after simplification
- Integration/e2e: Verify that UI elements use units properly in layout calculations
- Integration/e2e: Ensure different unit types are handled consistently

acceptance_criteria:
- All unit functionality remains intact with no breaking changes
- Units system is more consistent and easier to understand
- Performance of unit operations is maintained or improved
- Documentation for units is clearer and more comprehensive

validation:
- Run all existing unit-related tests
- Create a test example that demonstrates various unit types working together
- Verify that existing examples still work with the simplified system

notes:
- The current units system has some duplication in handling different unit types
- Unit conversion logic could be simplified to make it more predictable
- Need to maintain backward compatibility while improving structure
