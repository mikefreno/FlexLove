  priority: P2

  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Create comprehensive tests for font family inheritance functionality

deliverables:
- Test suite covering all font family inheritance scenarios
- Integration tests for theme font family support
- Unit tests for child font family override behavior
- End-to-end tests for inheritance chain validation

steps:
- Identify all font family inheritance scenarios that need testing
- Create test cases for parent-child font family relationships
- Develop integration tests for theme-based font family support
- Implement unit tests for font family override mechanisms
- Write end-to-end tests to validate inheritance chains
- Ensure all tests can be run independently and as a suite

tests:
- Unit: Test that font family inheritance works correctly in isolation
- Integration/e2e: Verify that themes properly support font families
- Integration/e2e: Ensure child elements can override parent font families
- Integration/e2e: Validate inheritance chains through multiple levels

acceptance_criteria:
- All font family inheritance functionality is thoroughly tested
- Tests cover edge cases and normal usage scenarios
- Test suite runs successfully and provides clear pass/fail results
- No regressions in existing functionality

validation:
- Run the complete test suite to verify all tests pass
- Create a sample application demonstrating font family inheritance
- Verify that existing examples still work correctly with tests

notes:
- This task focuses specifically on testing rather than implementation
- Tests should cover both simple and complex inheritance scenarios
- Need to ensure theme integration works properly with font families
