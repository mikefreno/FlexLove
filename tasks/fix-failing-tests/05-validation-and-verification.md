# 05. Validation and Verification

meta:
  id: fix-failing-tests-05
  feature: fix-failing-tests
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [fix-failing-tests-03, fix-failing-tests-04]
  tags: [verification, testing, validation]

objective:
- Verify all fixes work together and address remaining edge cases to reach 98% success rate

deliverables:
- Fix remaining test failures in comprehensive and performance tests
- Verify no regressions in previously passing tests
- Document any known limitations or edge cases
- Achieve 98% test success rate (320/326 passing)

steps:
1. Run full test suite and collect results
2. Fix testComplexDashboardLayout in `08_comprehensive_flex_tests.lua` (expected 1000, got 1020)
3. Address testExtremeScalePerformanceBenchmark in `10_performance_tests.lua`
4. Identify any remaining failures and categorize by severity
5. Fix high-priority failures (those affecting core functionality)
6. Document acceptable edge cases (if any remain below 98% threshold)
7. Run final verification of all test suites

tests:
- Integration: Run full test suite `testing/runAll.lua`
- Integration: Verify 08_comprehensive_flex_tests.lua passes
- Integration: Verify 10_performance_tests.lua passes or fails gracefully
- Regression: Verify no previously passing tests now fail
- Verification: Count passing tests >= 320 (98%)

acceptance_criteria:
- At least 320 out of 326 tests pass (98% success rate)
- testComplexDashboardLayout passes or error is < 2%
- Error count reduced from 39 to < 10
- No regressions in core functionality tests
- Test suite runs to completion without crashes

validation:
- Run: `cd /Users/mike/Code/station_alpha/game/libs && lua testing/runAll.lua`
- Count final results: "Ran 326 tests in X seconds, Y successes, Z failures, W errors"
- Verify: Y >= 320 (success rate >= 98%)
- Document: Any remaining failures with justification

notes:
- This is the final verification task
- Some edge case failures may be acceptable if they don't affect core functionality
- Performance test failures may be environment-dependent
- Priority is ensuring core layout features work correctly
- Document any test failures that are acceptable for the 98% target
- Consider if any tests have unrealistic expectations or need adjustment
