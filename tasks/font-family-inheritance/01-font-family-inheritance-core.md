# Font Family Inheritance Core Implementation

## Objective
Implement core font family inheritance logic that ensures children inherit font families from their parents, regardless of whether the child has a themeComponent set.

## Key Requirements
- Parent elements with fontFamily set should pass this to all children
- Inheritance should work even when parent has fontFamily set via theme system
- Children should inherit font families even if they don't have themeComponent set
- The inheritance mechanism should be efficient and not impact performance

## Implementation Plan
1. Modify the layout system to track font family inheritance
2. Add logic in child element processing to check for inherited font families
3. Ensure proper handling when theme system sets font families
4. Create a mechanism to override inherited font families when explicitly set on child elements

## Files to Modify
- FlexLove.lua (layout system core)
- Theme system files (if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All children inherit font family from parent
- Inheritance works through theme system
- No performance degradation
