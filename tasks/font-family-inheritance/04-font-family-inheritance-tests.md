# Font Family Inheritance Tests

## Objective
Create comprehensive tests for font family inheritance functionality.

## Key Requirements
- Test all inheritance scenarios (parent to child, theme-based, explicit override)
- Verify that font families are properly passed down through the hierarchy
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure performance is not degraded by inheritance logic

## Implementation Plan
1. Create test cases for basic inheritance from parent elements
2. Add tests for theme-based font family inheritance
3. Implement tests for explicit override scenarios
4. Add performance tests to ensure no regression
5. Run all tests and verify they pass

## Files to Modify
- testing/__tests__/ (new test files)
- FlexLove.lua (may need minor updates for test support)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All inheritance test cases pass
- Override test cases pass
- Performance is maintained
- Test coverage is comprehensive
