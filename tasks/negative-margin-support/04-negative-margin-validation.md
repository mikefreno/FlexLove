# 04. Negative Margin Validation

meta:
  id: negative-margin-support-04
  feature: negative-margin-support
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [negative-margin-support-01, negative-margin-support-02]
  tags: [implementation, validation-required]

objective:
- Implement validation logic for negative margin values to ensure they are properly handled and validated during layout calculations

deliverables:
- Validation functions for negative margin inputs
- Error handling for invalid negative margin values
- Integration of validation into the layout calculation process

steps:
- Create validation functions for negative margin values
- Implement error handling for edge cases (invalid types, out-of-range values)
- Integrate validation into the layout calculation process
- Ensure validation is applied consistently across all margin types (top, right, bottom, left)

tests:
- Unit: Test validation functions with various inputs including edge cases
- Integration/e2e: Test negative margins in layout scenarios with validation

acceptance_criteria:
- All validation functions properly handle valid negative margin values
- Invalid inputs are caught and handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
- Validation is consistently applied during layout calculations
- No regressions introduced to existing functionality

validation:
- Run validation tests to ensure all edge cases are covered
- Verify that invalid margin values are properly rejected
- Confirm that valid negative margins are processed correctly

notes:
- Build upon existing validation patterns in the codebase
- Ensure consistency with other margin validation logic
- Consider performance implications of validation checks
