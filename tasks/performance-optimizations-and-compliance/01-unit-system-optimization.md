  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Optimize the unit parsing and resolution system to reduce redundant calculations and improve performance

deliverables:
- Improved Units.parse() function with better caching
- Optimized Units.resolve() function for faster viewport calculations
- Updated Units.getViewport() with fallback handling

steps:
- Analyze current unit parsing and resolution logic in Units module
- Implement caching mechanism for parsed units to avoid repeated parsing
- Optimize viewport dimension fetching by reducing redundant calls
- Add performance tests to verify improvements

tests:
- Unit: Units.parse(), Units.resolve(), Units.getViewport()
- Integration/e2e: Layout calculations with various unit types (px, %, vw, vh)

acceptance_criteria:
- Unit parsing and resolution performance is improved by at least 30%
- Caching reduces redundant parsing operations
- Viewport fetching is optimized to minimize calls

validation:
- Run performance tests using existing test suite
- Measure time taken for unit resolution in layout calculations
- Compare before/after performance metrics

notes:
- The Units module is critical for responsive layouts and text sizing
- Optimization should not affect correctness of unit resolution
- Caching strategy needs to be thread-safe for concurrent access
