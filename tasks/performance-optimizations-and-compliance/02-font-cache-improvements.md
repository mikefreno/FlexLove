  priority: P2
  depends_on: [performance-optimizations-and-compliance-01]
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Improve the font caching system to reduce redundant font loading and improve performance

deliverables:
- Enhanced FONT_CACHE.get() function with better cache management
- Improved font loading error handling and fallback strategies
- Optimized cache key generation for faster lookups
- Updated font resolution logic in text rendering

steps:
- Analyze current font cache implementation in FONT_CACHE module
- Implement smarter cache eviction policy to prevent memory leaks
- Optimize cache key generation by using more efficient hashing
- Improve error handling for font loading failures
- Add performance monitoring for font cache operations

tests:
- Unit: FONT_CACHE.get(), FONT_CACHE.getFont()
- Integration/e2e: Text rendering with various font sizes and families

acceptance_criteria:
- Font cache performance is improved by at least 25%
- Memory leaks from font caching are eliminated
- Error handling for missing fonts works correctly
- Cache hit ratio is improved significantly

validation:
- Run performance tests using existing test suite
- Measure time taken for font loading operations
- Monitor memory usage during font rendering operations
- Compare before/after performance metrics

notes:
- Font loading is a major bottleneck in GUI rendering
- The FONT_CACHE module needs to be thread-safe for concurrent access
- Cache size should be configurable to balance performance vs memory usage
