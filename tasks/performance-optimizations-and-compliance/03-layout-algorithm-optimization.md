  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Optimize layout algorithms to reduce redundant calculations and improve performance

deliverables:
- Improved flexbox layout algorithm with better caching
- Optimized grid layout calculations
- Enhanced auto-sizing logic for elements
- Better handling of absolute positioning calculations

steps:
- Analyze current layout algorithms in Element class and Grid module
- Implement caching for layout calculations to avoid redundant work
- Optimize flexbox layout by reducing unnecessary iterations
- Improve grid layout algorithm with more efficient space calculation
- Add performance monitoring for layout operations

tests:
- Unit: Element:layoutChildren(), Grid.layoutGridItems()
- Integration/e2e: Complex layouts with nested elements and various positioning modes

acceptance_criteria:
- Layout calculation performance is improved by at least 40%
- Caching reduces redundant layout computations
- Auto-sizing works correctly across different element configurations
- Absolute positioning calculations are efficient

validation:
- Run performance tests using existing test suite
- Measure time taken for layout calculations in complex scenarios
- Compare before/after performance metrics
- Test with various nested layouts to ensure correctness

notes:
- Layout algorithms are the most computationally expensive part of GUI rendering
- Caching should be smart enough to invalidate when elements change
- Performance improvements should not affect visual correctness
