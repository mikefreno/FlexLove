  priority: P2
  depends_on: []
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Improve event system predictability and determinism to ensure consistent behavior across different scenarios

deliverables:
- Predictable event propagation order
- Deterministic event handling for overlapping elements
- Clear event bubbling and capture phases
- Improved event callback execution order

steps:
- Analyze current event system implementation in Element class
- Implement consistent z-index based event ordering
- Add event propagation phases (capture, target, bubble)
- Ensure event handlers execute in predictable order
- Add event system documentation and examples
- Create comprehensive event system tests

tests:
- Unit: Event creation, propagation, and handling functions
- Integration/e2e: Complex nested element event scenarios with overlapping elements

acceptance_criteria:
- Events are processed in consistent z-index order
- Event propagation follows standard capture/bubble model
- No race conditions in event handling
- Event system behavior is fully documented

validation:
- Run event system tests to verify predictable behavior
- Test with complex nested layouts and overlapping elements
- Verify event handling order matches documentation
- Compare behavior with standard DOM event model

notes:
- Current event system may have inconsistent ordering with overlapping elements
- Need to follow W3C event model for predictability
- Z-index should determine event target selection for overlapping elements
