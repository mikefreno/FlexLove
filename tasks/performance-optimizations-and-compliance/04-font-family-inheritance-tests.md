objective:
- Create comprehensive tests for font family inheritance functionality

deliverables:
- Test suite covering font family inheritance scenarios
- Integration tests for theme font family support
- Unit tests for child font family override behavior
- Performance tests for inheritance calculations

steps:
- Analyze existing font family inheritance logic in Element class
- Create test cases for various inheritance scenarios (theme, parent, child)
- Implement integration tests for theme-based font family handling
- Add performance monitoring for inheritance operations
- Document test coverage and expected behaviors

tests:
- Unit: Font family inheritance logic in Element class
- Integration/e2e: Complex layouts with font family inheritance chains
- Performance: Timing of inheritance calculations

acceptance_criteria:
- All font family inheritance scenarios are covered by tests
- Theme-based font family support works correctly
- Child override behavior is properly tested
- Performance metrics for inheritance operations are recorded

validation:
- Run all new test cases using existing test framework
- Verify that inheritance logic behaves as expected in various scenarios
- Check performance metrics against baseline

notes:
- Font family inheritance is critical for consistent UI styling
- Tests should cover edge cases like missing font families, nested inheritance
- Performance testing should measure time taken for inheritance calculations
