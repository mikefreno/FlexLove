  priority: P2
  depends_on: []
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Improve theme system stability and handle edge cases gracefully to prevent crashes and unexpected behavior

deliverables:
- Robust error handling for missing theme assets
- Graceful fallbacks for invalid theme definitions
- Better validation of theme component structure
- Improved theme switching without memory leaks

steps:
- Analyze current theme system for potential failure points
- Add validation for theme definitions at load time
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing assets
- Add error handling for invalid theme components
- Prevent memory leaks during theme switching
- Create comprehensive theme system tests

tests:
- Unit: Theme loading, validation, and asset resolution
- Integration/e2e: Theme switching scenarios with missing assets and invalid definitions

acceptance_criteria:
- Theme system handles missing assets gracefully
- Invalid theme definitions are caught at load time
- Theme switching doesn't cause memory leaks
- Clear error messages for theme-related issues

validation:
- Test with intentionally broken theme definitions
- Verify memory usage during repeated theme switches
- Test with missing font files and image assets
- Ensure fallback to default theme works correctly

notes:
- Current theme system may crash with missing assets
- Need better validation at theme load time
- Theme switching should clean up previous theme resources
