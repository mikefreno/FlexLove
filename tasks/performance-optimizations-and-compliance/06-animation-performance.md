  depends_on: []
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Optimize animation system to achieve smooth 60fps performance with multiple concurrent animations

deliverables:
- Optimized Animation.update() method
- Efficient easing function implementations
- Animation batching for multiple simultaneous animations
- Reduced garbage collection during animation updates

steps:
- Profile current animation system performance
- Optimize animation interpolation calculations
- Implement animation batching to reduce overhead
- Add support for hardware-accelerated transforms where possible
- Minimize object allocations during animation updates
- Create performance benchmarks for animation system

tests:
- Unit: Animation.update(), Animation.interpolate()
- Integration/e2e: Multiple concurrent animations on different elements

acceptance_criteria:
- 60fps maintained with 50+ concurrent animations
- Animation interpolation overhead reduced by 40%
- No garbage collection spikes during animations
- Smooth transitions without frame drops

validation:
- Run performance benchmarks with varying animation counts
- Profile memory usage during extended animation sequences
- Test with complex animation chains and nested animations
- Verify frame timing consistency

notes:
- Current animation system may cause frame drops with many concurrent animations
- Need to minimize allocations in hot paths
- Consider using object pools for animation state
