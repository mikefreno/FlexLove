  priority: P2

  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Improve window resize handling to prevent layout thrashing and ensure smooth responsive behavior

deliverables:
- Optimized Element:resize() method
- Debounced resize event handling
- Efficient viewport dimension caching
- Reduced layout recalculations during resize

steps:
- Analyze current resize handling performance
- Implement resize event debouncing to reduce updates
- Cache viewport dimensions to avoid repeated queries
- Optimize layout recalculation during resize
- Add resize performance monitoring
- Create tests for resize behavior

tests:
- Unit: Element:resize(), Units.getViewport()
- Integration/e2e: Resize behavior with complex nested layouts

acceptance_criteria:
- Resize operations complete within 16ms (60fps)
- Layout recalculations are minimized during resize
- Viewport dimension queries are cached appropriately
- Smooth visual updates during window resize

validation:
- Profile resize performance with complex layouts
- Test rapid resize events to verify debouncing
- Measure layout recalculation frequency during resize
- Verify visual smoothness during interactive resize

notes:
- Current implementation may recalculate layouts too frequently
- Viewport dimension queries can be expensive
- Need to balance responsiveness with performance
