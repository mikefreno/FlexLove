  priority: P2
  depends_on: []
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Optimize the Element:draw() method to reduce rendering overhead and improve frame rates

deliverables:
- Optimized Element:draw() method with reduced state changes
- Efficient clipping and stencil operations
- Batched rendering where possible
- Reduced redundant draw calls

steps:
- Profile current draw method performance
- Minimize graphics state changes during rendering
- Optimize stencil operations for rounded corners
- Implement draw call batching for similar elements
- Reduce redundant color and font state changes
- Add rendering performance metrics

tests:
- Unit: Element:draw() method
- Integration/e2e: Complex layouts with many elements and nested structures

acceptance_criteria:
- Draw method overhead reduced by 30%
- Graphics state changes minimized
- Rendering maintains 60fps with 500+ visible elements
- No visual artifacts from optimizations

validation:
- Profile rendering performance with varying element counts
- Measure graphics state change frequency
- Test with complex nested layouts and rounded corners
- Verify visual correctness after optimizations

notes:
- Current draw method may have redundant state changes
- Stencil operations for rounded corners can be expensive
- Need to balance optimization with code clarity
