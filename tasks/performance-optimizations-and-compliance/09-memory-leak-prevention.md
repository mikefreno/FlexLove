  priority: P2
  depends_on: []
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Identify and eliminate memory leaks to ensure stable long-running applications

deliverables:
- Proper cleanup in Element:destroy() method
- Circular reference detection and prevention
- Font cache eviction policy
- Event listener cleanup mechanisms

steps:
- Audit codebase for potential memory leaks
- Implement proper resource cleanup in destroy methods
- Add weak references where appropriate
- Implement font cache size limits and eviction
- Add event listener cleanup on element destruction
- Create memory leak detection tests

tests:
- Unit: Element:destroy(), FONT_CACHE eviction
- Integration/e2e: Long-running scenarios with element creation/destruction cycles

acceptance_criteria:
- No memory growth in long-running applications
- All resources properly cleaned up on element destruction
- Font cache size bounded and eviction works correctly
- Event listeners removed when elements are destroyed

validation:
- Run memory profiling over extended periods
- Test repeated element creation/destruction cycles
- Monitor font cache size during extended use
- Verify no orphaned event listeners remain

notes:
- Lua's garbage collector may mask some leaks temporarily
- Need to test with realistic usage patterns over time
- Font cache can grow unbounded without eviction policy
- Event listeners on destroyed elements can prevent garbage collection
