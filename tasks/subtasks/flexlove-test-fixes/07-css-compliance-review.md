  tags: [css-compliance, review, validation, specification]

objective:
- Comprehensive review of all functionality to ensure CSS specification compliance
- Validate that all test successes assume proper CSS logic and behavior

deliverables:
- Complete review of positioning behavior against CSS positioning specification
- Validation of flexbox implementation against CSS flexbox specification
- Verification of text rendering and scaling against CSS text specification
- Documentation of CSS compliance gaps and recommendations
- Final test suite validation ensuring all assumptions are CSS-compliant

steps:
- Review all positioning logic for CSS positioning specification compliance
- Validate flexbox implementation against official CSS flexbox specification
- Check text scaling and rendering against CSS text rendering standards
- Review units system for CSS units specification compliance
- Validate color handling against CSS color specification
- Examine all successful tests to ensure CSS-compliant assumptions
- **CRITICAL: Identify and document any remaining non-CSS-compliant behavior**

tests:
- Integration: Run complete test suite and verify all tests pass
- Compliance: Validate positioning behavior matches CSS positioning spec
- Compliance: Validate flexbox behavior matches CSS flexbox spec  
- Compliance: Validate text rendering matches CSS text spec
- Compliance: Validate units system matches CSS units spec
- Review: Examine successful tests for CSS compliance assumptions

acceptance_criteria:
- All 271 tests pass without errors or failures
- Positioning behavior fully compliant with CSS positioning specification
- Flexbox implementation fully compliant with CSS flexbox specification
- Text rendering and scaling compliant with CSS text specification
- Units system fully compliant with CSS units specification
- Color handling compliant with CSS color specification
- All test assumptions verified as CSS-compliant
- **CRITICAL: No behavior deviates from CSS standards**

validation:
- Run: lua testing/runAll.lua
- Verify: All 271 tests pass (0 errors, 0 failures)
- Compare: Positioning behavior vs CSS positioning specification
- Compare: Flexbox behavior vs CSS flexbox specification
- Compare: Text behavior vs CSS text specification
- Compare: Units behavior vs CSS units specification
- Review: All test files for CSS-compliant assumptions
- Document: Any remaining CSS compliance gaps

notes:
- CSS positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed positioning rules
- CSS flexbox: main axis, cross axis, justify-content, align-items, flex-wrap specifications
- CSS text: font sizing, text measurement, baseline calculations
- CSS units: px, em, rem, %, vh, vw, and other unit handling
- CSS colors: hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla color format support
- **REMEMBER: This review is critical - ALL behavior must assume proper CSS logic and follow CSS specifications exactly**
- Any deviation from CSS standards must be documented and justified
