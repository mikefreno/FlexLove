objective:
- Validate all fixes against CSS specifications and ensure complete test suite passes with 100% success rate

deliverables:
- Complete test suite validation report
- CSS Flexbox compliance verification
- Performance benchmarking results
- Documentation of any remaining edge cases or limitations

steps:
- Run all 11 test files sequentially to verify complete fix success
- Compare FlexLove behavior against CSS Flexbox specification
- Validate performance characteristics meet expected thresholds
- Document any deviations from CSS specifications with justification
- Create test summary report showing before/after results
- Verify no regressions introduced by fixes

tests:
- Full suite: Run all tests 01-11 and verify 100% pass rate
- CSS compliance: Test against known CSS Flexbox behaviors
- Performance: Verify performance benchmarks are met
- Regression: Ensure no previously passing tests now fail

acceptance_criteria:
- All 11 test files pass with 100% success rate
- FlexLove behavior matches CSS Flexbox specifications within reasonable tolerances
- No performance regressions introduced
- All identified issues from original test run are resolved

validation:
- Run: `lua testing/runAll.lua` (if available) or each test individually
- Verify: 100% pass rate across all test files
- Check: No failures, errors, or performance issues remain

notes:
- This is the final validation step ensuring all fixes work together
- Focus on integration testing and CSS compliance
- Document any intentional deviations from CSS specifications
